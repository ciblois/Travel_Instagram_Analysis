## Dataset
* Survey Collected
* Data observation

### Survey

The survey consisted of trying to understand whether Instagram travel is something that people are interested in. In addition, try to understand through some questions the preferences of people who are interested in the topic. The questions are:

* Do you follow any travel Instagram?
* Do you follow any travel-related hashtag?
* Do you prefer to see photos with people or just places?
* Is the description of the photo important to you?
* Do you prefer culture, nature, or food posts?
* Do you usually comment when you like the photo?

### Data Observation

10 profiles with at least 10k followers were chosen to obtain information about the last 10 photos posted in their feeds. 
The information collected was username, the number of followers for each profile, total number of posts for each profile, location, number of likes, number of comments per photo, and categorized the types of places for each photo, separated the photos into 2 categories: with people and without people and finally I checked for the use of hashtag in caption.
